# Introduction to Financial Engineering

## Overview

This repository contains projects developed as part of my university coursework in **Financial Engineering**. Each project aligns with topics covered in the course, which focuses on the application of mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques in finance. The projects are designed to demonstrate a practical understanding of financial concepts, using computational tools like **R** for implementation.

## Projects in This Repository

The projects in this repository were delivered as part of my university coursework and are directly related to the topics covered in the Financial Engineering course. They include practical applications of the theories and models learned during the course. Each project involves coding in **R** and demonstrates concepts such as:

- Time Series modeling (ARMA, GARCH)
- Option pricing using stochastic calculus
- Financial optimization for portfolio management
- Risk estimation and analysis of financial crises

These projects provide real-world examples of how financial theory is applied through quantitative methods in areas like forecasting, pricing, and risk management. All code and reports are written and structured to meet the assignment requirements, with a focus on accuracy, clarity, and adherence to the methodologies taught during the course.

## Evaluation and Coursework

The evaluation for the course included a combination of assignments, practical problem-solving, and a final exam. All projects were part of my coursework submissions, showcasing the practical implementation of the course's theoretical concepts.
